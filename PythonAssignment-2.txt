## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans:Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.
    When compiled, other languages turn into Assembly and run directly in the processor. Hence, being an interpreted language, which is not subject to the processor, 
makes Python a high-level programming language

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans: Python automatialy assign the data type for the value during runtime.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans:
Pros:
    1) Simple and easy 2) Many libraries 3)Interpreted language

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans: Variable are containers for storing a value. In python, data type for a variable is declared once you asssign a value.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans: By using the input() function.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans: By default it takes the value as String type

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Changing the data type of one variable to another is called type casting.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: No, We cannot able to take more than one input by using single input function. If we pass more than one value it will throw an error.

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: Keywords are reserved words. Also we cannot able to use keywords as variables.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
