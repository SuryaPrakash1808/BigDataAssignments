## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: It is simple and also easily readable by humans

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans: Python automatialy assign the data type for the value during runtime.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans:
Pros:
    1) Simple and easy 2) Many libraries 3)Interpreted language
Cons:
    2)Slow 2)Design restrictions 3)Underdeveloped DB access layers

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans: 1)Web development 2)Game development 3)Web Testing(Selinium) 4)Big data 5)Data Science

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans: Variable are containers for storing a value. In python, data type for a variable is declared once you asssign a value.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans: By using the input() function.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans: By default it takes the value as String type

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Changing the data type of one variable to another is called type casting.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: No, We cannot able to take more than one input by using single input function. If we pass more than one value it will throw an error.

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: Keywords are reserved words. Also we cannot able to use keywords as variables.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: No, We cannot use keywords as variable. It will throw an error if we use keywords as variable.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans: Indentation is giving some space between codes. Indentaion increase the readability and also reduces the use of paranthesis.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: We can thrw output by using print() function.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans: 1)Assignment operators 2)Numerical operators 3)Compaision operators 4)Logical operators 5)Identity operators 6)Bitwise operators 7)Menbership operators

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans: /(float division)- Gives float values
     //(Integer division)- Gives only interger values

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans:
print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans:
a=int(input("Enter the value of a = "))
if(a%2==0):
    print(a,"is even")
else:
    print(a,"is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans: 1)True
     2)False

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0
Ans: 1

0 and 0
Ans: 1

True and False and True
Ans: False

1 or 0 or 0
Ans: 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans: 1)if
     2)if-else
     3)Nested if-else

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: Those keywords are used for decision making. The program will execute the code based on those condition.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans:
a=int(input("Enter the age = "))
if(a<18):
    print("I can't vote")
elif(a>=18):
    print("I can vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
a=0
for x in numbers:
    if(x%2==0):
            a+=x
print(a)
    

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans:
a=int(input("enter the vaue of a = "))
b=int(input("enter the vaue of b = "))
c=int(input("enter the vaue of c = "))
if(a>b and a>c):
    print(a," is greater")
elif(b>c and b>a):
    print(b," is greater")
else:
    print(c," is greater")

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for x in numbers:
    if(x%5==0):
        if(x<500):
            if(x<150):
                print(x)
            else:
                continue
        else:
            break
